<!-- ## RocksDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for Flash and RAM Storage

[![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb)

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key-value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

## HeapKV: Enabling Efficient Garbage Collection for KV-Separated LSM Stores on Modern SSDs

### Introduction

Key-value (KV) separation has emerged as a pivotal solution to tackle write amplification in LSM-tree-based KV stores (LSM stores). However, the garbage collection (GC) mechanism essential for reclaiming obsolete values introduces substantial overheads: (i) Additional LSM-tree I/O operations degrade foreground performance and cause data inconsistency issues; (ii) Exacerbated write amplification arises from excessive valid data migration in update-intensive workloads. Moreover, existing GC optimization schemes fundamentally struggle to balance space overhead, write amplification, and system performance. We propose HeapKV, a high-performance KV separated LSM store that improves GC efficiency through three key technologies: (i) A lightweight two-level index and a global garbage view decouple GC operations of value storage from the LSM-tree, eliminating additional I/O operations; (ii) A novel valid data migration scheme mitigates write amplification during space reclamation by in-place overwrites and logical data copying; (iii) SSD-conscious I/O optimizations featuring asynchronous value flushing, fast read paths and concurrent prefetching for range queries.

### Overview

This repository contains a naive prototype of HeapKV that written in C++ based on [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) v8.11.3 . The core implementation of HeapKV is under `db/heap` directory.

## Build

### Requirement

- Linux Kernal 6.x (recommended)
- g++ 13.0+
- [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake) 3.10.0+
- [liburing](https://github.com/axboe/liburing) 2.6+
- filesystem that support reflink feature (e.g. XFS, Btrfs, ZFS...)

### Clone repository


```
$ git clone https://github.com/PDS-Lab/HeapKV.git
```

### Build

```
# use CC=gcc-13 CXX=g++-13 if the default compiler of your system is not g++ 13
# ninja librocksdb.so if you need shared lib

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. -GNinja
$ ninja librocksdb.a
```

### Usage

```cmake
target_include_directories(${target} ${PATH_TO_HEAPKV}/include)
target_link_libraries(${target} ${PATH_TO_HEAPKV}/build/librocksdb.so uring)
```

## HeapKV Specific Configuration

```
enable_heapkv: whether use heapkv key-value separation

min_heap_value_size: value â‰¥ this setting while be separated during flush operation

heap_extent_relocate_threshold: the GC ratio of HeapKV. (i.e. 0.3 means GC will be triggered if 30% of space are garbage or unavailable fragmentation)

enable_fast_path_update: whether update fast path info during compaction

heap_value_cache: the cache object to use for value and value index in extent file. It is recommended to create a new cache instance instead of using block cache of rocksdb.
